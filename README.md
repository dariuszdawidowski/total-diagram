# About

A library for rendering diagrams consisting of nodes and links.
Designed for simplicity, it can be the basis for creating a diagramming application or data representation on a website.

# Quick Start

For more details look into 'examples/' directory. You can find self-explanatory tutorials there.

# Philosophy behind the library

Does the world need yet another library for displaying diagrams?
I tried most of them and the problem I encountered was that I couldn't realize my idea because it was inconsistent with the vision of the creators of the library.
The bigger and more complicated the library becomes, the less flexible it is proportionally.
The basis of this project is very clean and simple, no need to complicate it.
The first thing you should do is analyze all the files in the 'examples' directory, which are a kind of tutorial on how to build your own diagramming system based on this solution.
If you are looking for an example of building a larger system based on this library, see the project https://github.com/dariuszdawidowski/metaviz-editor.
